Think iv given up on getting the images to work.
For whatever reason, nextjs just refuses to upload images. It works for icons. Just not images. 
Iv basically tried all day just to get it to work, to zero avail.
If you run it off vercel though it works perfectly fine. I just dont know whats wrong with this.
